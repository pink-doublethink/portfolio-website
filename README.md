### What is the project about?
---
- This is my personal website repository. It contains links to my latest work, my articles on frontend development, and general information about me.

- In this project I implemented: 
	- created two language versions by redirecting the user to the right version of the site depending on the language of his browser and device;
	- used a CSS module Styles object and React context to create a color theme;
	- used variant fonts to create the content composition of the site;
